### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: Will Donald Trump Serve a Second Term?
+ This project is conducted by Xueyao Li.

+ Project summary: 
In this project, I discussed the differences between one-term and two-term presidents in the use of words, length of sentences, emotions and topics. And then, I analyzed the similarities and differences between Trump and these two groups. 

In conclusion, Trump is more likely to be a one-term president for his use of words, emotions and topics. However, Trump is a really special president in the United States, like his short sentences and strong positive sentiment. Therefore, it is hard to make a prediction based on the analysis of inaugural speeches.
